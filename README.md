# CLIPS-ArduinoNanoESP32
A porting of [CLIPS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clipsrules/) to [Arduino Nano ESP32](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-esp32/).

The CLIPS Reference Manual states:

"_CLIPS programs may be executed in three ways: interactively using a simple Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) interface; interactively using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) interface; or as embedded application in which the user provides a main program and controls execution of the expert system through the CLIPS Application Programming Interface (API)._"

This project also consists of mapping the Read-Eval-Print Loop with the standard loop operation of Arduino and integrating "facts" with states/levels of its pins... and much more. This enables endless application possibilities in the field of IoT and automation, as well as benefits such as code portability. COOL coding!

> This project is a prototype and is still under development. While it works, it has not been thoroughly tested and may not be stable. **Not recommended for production use.**
